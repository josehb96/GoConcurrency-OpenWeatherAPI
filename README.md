# GoConcurrency-OpenWeatherAPI
Repository with a simple project to put in practice and demonstrate the potential of Go Concurrency using Go Routines and Channels.

In this case I'm using the Open Weather API to check the difference in terms of time results between not using Concurrency and using Concurrency.

# Concurrency in Golang Project

This project showcases the ease of implementing concurrency in Golang using go routines and channels. Concurrency allows for efficient task execution, API calls, aggregating data, and more. By effectively utilizing all available resources, concurrency significantly improves program efficiency.

## Features
- Demonstrates the benefits of concurrency in Golang
- Utilizes go routines and channels for efficient task execution
- Shows significant improvements in execution times compared to non-concurrent solutions
- Includes a real API example to illustrate the advantages of concurrency

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the project using Golang.
4. Explore the code to understand how concurrency is implemented.
5. Check the real API example to see the improvements in execution times.
