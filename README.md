# GoConcurrency-OpenWeatherAPI
Repository with a project to put in practice and demonstrate the potential of Go Concurrency using Go Routines and Channels.

In this case I'm using the Open Weather API to check the difference in terms of time results between not using Concurrency and using Concurrency.
